"""Pydantic v2 schemas for ``POST /v1/scans``, commit, and ``GET /v1/scans/{id}``.

All request models use ``ConfigDict(strict=True, extra="forbid")`` per
PATTERNS.md backend-hardening: strict prevents implicit coercion of
unexpected types (e.g. integer ``1`` flowing into a string field), and
``extra="forbid"`` rejects unknown keys at the boundary so a client
cannot pass through fields the validator does not recognise.

Response models intentionally relax this: the server is the source of
truth, and we want forward-compatibility with future fields without
breaking existing clients.
